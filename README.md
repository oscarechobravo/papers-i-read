# Papers-I-read

Here is a dump of my bibliography from my PhD thesis work and subsequent projects on campus/city energy, and freight logistics/transport.

Primarily these repositories contain publications gear more towards an HCI/design approach to areas in which Computer Science can help solve problems.

This repository is currently structured in a per project manner, but given the overlap in research areas I should probably think like this:

``VENUE A
|
-- Application Area A
|
-- Application Area B
|
-- Application Area ... N
|
VENUE B
|
-- Application Area ... N
|
...``
