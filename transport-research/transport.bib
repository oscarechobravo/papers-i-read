@article{Allen2017,
	Abstract = {Abstract Growth in e-commerce has led to increasing use of light goods vehicles for parcel deliveries in urban areas. This paper provides an insight into the reasons behind this growth and the resulting effort required to meet the exacting delivery services offered by e-retailers which often lead to poor vehicle utilisation in the last-mile operation, as well as the duplication of delivery services in urban centres as competitors vie for business. A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62% of the total vehicle round time and 40% of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels. },

@article{doi:10.1108/IJLM-02-2013-0021,
	Abstract = { Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to investigate empirically how information and communication technologies (ICT) can contribute to reduction of CO2 emissions in road freight transport and to identify opportunities for further improvements. Design/methodology/approach -- This research adopts a multiple case study approach with three leading UK grocery retailers as exemplars of fast-moving consumer goods retailers, conducted using multiple data collection techniques including interviews, system demonstrations, onsite observations and the use of archive information. Findings -- ICT solutions have a direct positive impact on CO2 emissions reduction but opportunities to further reduce CO2 emissions are perceived as lying beyond retailers' own distribution networks. These opportunities are not fully utilised due to the complexities of collaborative ICT provisions and retailers' reluctance to share information with competitors. Research limitations/implications -- A limitation of the study is that it is exploratory and only three cases were examined. Even though these three retailers represent over 60 per cent of the UK grocery retail sector, other retailers may deploy significantly different ICT applications. Practical implications -- The research provides an overarching insight for businesses on how to leverage the existing and emerging information technologies for environmental and economic benefits. Originality/value -- While sustainability issues have received increasing attention recently, the role of ICT in freight transport for CO2 emissions reduction has not been investigated in depth and its impact is largely unknown. This research advances understanding about how ICT contributes CO2 emissions reductions and provides a framework for further investigation. },

@article{Nyce1993,
	Abstract = {To understand how video telephone technology could support consultations between pathologists and surgeons, this study looked at what constitutes `work' in clinical consultations. Using several methods (participant observation, video and interviews), we found pathologists and surgeons both share and do not share similar understandings of what a consultation is, what one should achieve in a consultation, and what in fact constitutes a `successful' consultation. Furthermore, the same objects of consultation (the products of `offstage' work) can be used and defined quite differently depending on how a consultation is framed. Differences and disjunctions like these have to be better understood if computer-supported cooperative healthcare work (CSCHW) applications are to be adopted and accepted.},

	Abstract = {Under the new economic forms of China's ``Internet +'' strategy, the Internet technologies spill over into different areas in a variety of traditional industries. As a result, electronic commerce develops rapidly. With the sustainable increase of consumers shopping online, the logistics problems have become the biggest obstacle of the development of electronic commerce. We argue that one can solve the current problems in logistics and improve consumers' satisfaction by establishing a long-term relationship of value co-creation between electronic commerce enterprises and logistics service providers. In this paper, we build a game model of electronic commerce enterprises and logistics service providers based on knowledge-sharing. We analyze the cases of one-shot game and repeated game. According to model analysis, we propose strategies for electronic commerce enterprises and logistics service providers to co-create value on the basis of knowledge-sharing from two different angles, i.e., the whole supply chain's and its members' perspective. These strategies may have implications to practice.},

	Abstract = { Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to explore the quality factors influencing customer satisfaction in the electronic commerce (e-commerce) context using a triadic view of customer-e-retailer-third-party logistics provider, and to investigate the impacts of service quality on customer satisfaction and loyalty in the e-retailing supply chain. Design/methodology/approach -- A literature review is used to determine the conceptual model and develop the measurement scales. Data are collected through a web survey mainly conducted in China. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the collected data and test the research hypotheses. Findings -- The results verify the proposed service quality framework, consisting of two dimensions (electronic service (e-service) quality and logistics service quality), in the e-commerce context. The results indicate that e-service quality and logistics service quality are strongly linked to customer satisfaction; that is, with e-service and logistics service, respectively. e-Service quality positively impacts customer satisfaction with logistics services, but logistics service quality negatively impacts customer satisfaction with e-services. Moreover, customer satisfaction with e-services is positively associated with customer loyalty for both e-services and logistics services. However, customer satisfaction with logistics services has no direct impact on related customer loyalty, and negatively impacts customer loyalty with e-services. Research limitations/implications -- The survey focusses only on China; future data should verify whether different cultural backgrounds will impact the research results. Practical implications -- The results show that e-retailers should not only focus on e-service quality, but also logistics service quality, which is critical to the success of e-commerce. Originality/value -- A two-dimensional (e-service and logistics) service quality framework is proposed and empirically assessed in the context of the e-retailing supply chain. These impacts of the path of service quality on customer satisfaction and loyalty are highlighted. },
